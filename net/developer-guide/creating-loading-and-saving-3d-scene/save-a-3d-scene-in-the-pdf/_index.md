The [Scene](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/3d/T_Aspose_ThreeD_Scene) class of the Aspose.3D API represents a 3D scene. Developers can build a 3D scene by adding Camera, Light, polygons and various other entities. They can also now save a 3D scene in the PDF file format.

Aspose.3D for .NET directly writes the information about the API and Version Number in output documents. For example, upon rendering a Drawing to PDF, Aspose.3D for .NET populates **Application** field with value 'Aspose.3D' and **PDF Producer** field with value, e.g 'Aspose.3D 17.9'.

Please note that you cannot instruct Aspose.Diagram for .NET API to change or remove this information from output Documents.
