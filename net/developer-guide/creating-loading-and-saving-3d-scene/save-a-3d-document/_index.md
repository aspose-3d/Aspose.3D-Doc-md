The [Scene](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene) class of the Aspose.3D API represents a 3D document and developers can save its object in any supported file format. To save a 3D Scene, simply use the [Scene.Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene/methods/save) method, it accepts a file name with complete path or a file stream object. Aspose.3D API offers another FileFormat parameter to specify output file format.
