The left cylinder has ShearBottom to (0, 0.83) while the right one is an ordinal cylinder.
# **Create Fan-Cylinder**
Aspose.3D for .NET allows creating a fan cylinder. In order to use this functionality, you can set **GenerateFanCylinder** property of **Cylinder** class to **True.** The following code snippet shows how to use this functionality:



{{< gist "aspose-3d-gists" "9563193e834f0087b554c83130fcf7c7" "Examples-CSharp-WorkingWithCylinder-CustomizedShearBottomCylinder-1.cs" >}}
