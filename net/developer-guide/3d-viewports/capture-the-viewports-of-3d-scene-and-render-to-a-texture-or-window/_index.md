## **Capturing and Rendering the Viewports of 3D Scene**
The CreateRenderTexture and CreateRenderWindow methods exposed by the [RenderFactory](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/renderfactory) class can be used to create a new render target that renders the scene to a texture or Window.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example captures a viewport of 3D Scene and renders it in two different ways.
