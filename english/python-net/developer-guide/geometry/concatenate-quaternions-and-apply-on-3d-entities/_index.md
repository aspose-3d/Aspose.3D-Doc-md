## **ConcatenateÂ Quaternions**
Quaternions are used to represent an orientation in 3D space. The `concat` method exposed by the [`Quaternion`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.utilities/quaternion) class can be used to combine two quaternions. In this code example, we combine two quaternions and get a third resulting quaternion, and then apply these three quaternions to three cylinders.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example combine two quaternions and apply them to different cylinders.

**Result in 3ds MAX**
