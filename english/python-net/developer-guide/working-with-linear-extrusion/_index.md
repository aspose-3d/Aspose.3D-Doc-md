# **`center` in Linear Extrusion**
Aspose.3D for Python via .NET offers `center` property of `LinearExtrusion` class. If the `center` property is set to `True`, the extrusion range is from -Height/2 to Height/2, otherwise, the extrusion is from 0 to Height. Following code snippet shows how to use `center` property in linear extrusion:
