## **Apply Visual Effects on 3D View**
The [`get_post_processing`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/renderer/methods/getpostprocessing) method of the [`Renderer`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/renderer) class allows to create any supported visual effect. The `Renderer` class offers a [`post_processings`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/renderer/properties/postprocessings) member to apply various filters, the Add method of the `PostProcessings` class allows to incorporate a filter before rendering.
