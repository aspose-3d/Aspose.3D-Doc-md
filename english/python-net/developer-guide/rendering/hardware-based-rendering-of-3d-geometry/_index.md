Using [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net/) API, developers can program the GPU (graphics processing unit) and setup the graphics hardware for rendering 3D geometry instead of the fixed function pipeline. In this article, we focus on hardware-based rendering using [OpenGL 4.0](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/html/glEnable.xhtml), [DirectX 11](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh404489\(v=vs.85\).aspx), [DirectX 9](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb147327\(v=vs.85\).aspx) and [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/xhtml/vkspec.html#VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo).

## **Create Hardware and Render a 3D Geometry**
To render a 3D geometry, a shader, buffers and render state are required. None of them can work without each other.

- **Buffers** - Triangle lists are individual triangles specified in an array that is sometimes referred to as a buffer. In a triangle list, each triangle is individually specified. Points of a triangle can be shared by using indices to reduce the amount of data that must be passed to the graphics hardware.
- **Shaders** - It defines how to transform the triangles from world space into screen space and calculate the final pixel color in GPU side
- **Render States** - It provides parameters for the GPU to rasterize the triangles into pixels.

We have prepared a demo project. Please refer to [this download URL](https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-.NET/tree/master/HardwareBasedRendering).

The OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) is the standard high level shading language for the OpenGL graphics API. There are three shader types commonly used: Vertex Shaders, Fragment Shaders and Geometry Shaders.

[`GLSLSource`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/glslsource) class tells the renderer, the source code is for OpenGL shading language, it can be compiled to [`ShaderProgram`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/shaderprogram) class. The [`ShaderVariable`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.render/shadervariable) class defines the variables used in the shader. The `VariableSemantic` class is used to identify the shader variable's semantic, Aspose.3D renderer will automatically prepare shader variable values depends on the semantics.
### **Programming Sample for Shader**
This code example initializes renderer and Shader for the grid. You can download complete working project of this example from [here](https://github.com/aspose-3d/Aspose.3D-for-.NET/tree/master/HardwareBasedRendering).
