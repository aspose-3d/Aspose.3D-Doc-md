## **Create Polygon In Mesh**
Aspose.3D for Python via .NET allows creating a polygon in a mesh. In order to use the functionality, the API offers [`create_polygon`](https://reference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.entities/mesh/methods/createpolygon) method of [`Mesh`](https://reference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.entities/mesh) class. Using `create_polygon` method you can create an optimized [Triangle ](https://reference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.entities/mesh/methods/createpolygon)or [Quad ](https://reference.aspose.com/net/3d/aspose.threed.entities.mesh/createpolygon/methods/1)polygon without allocating extra memory. The following code snippet shows how to use this functionality.
