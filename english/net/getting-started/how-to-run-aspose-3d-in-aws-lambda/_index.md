## Prepare AWS environment

## Create a project running in AWS Lambda

1. Create an ASP.NET Core Web Application in Visual Studio, write test code, get Aspose.3D from nuget.

1. Make sure the test project runs well on your local machine, then deploy it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
   Right click the project name, choose "Publish to AWS Elastic Beanstalk". (This option will only exists after you install AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio). 
1. You will need to add a new user with your AWS account and IAM user, you can import "credentials.csv" file which you get in the previous step. 
1. Publish success, you will get a link address like: `http://testprojectaspose-test.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/`
   Wait 10 minutes for the link to take effect, then you can visit it!
