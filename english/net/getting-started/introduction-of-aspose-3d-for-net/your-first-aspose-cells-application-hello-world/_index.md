## **How to Create the Application**

The steps below creates the application using the Aspose.3D API:

1. Create an instance of the [Scene](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene/) class.
1. If you have a license, then [apply it](/3d/net/licensing/).
   If you are using the evaluation version, skip the license related code lines.
1. Create a new 3D file, or open an existing 3D file.
1. Access the scene contents in the 3D file.
1. Generate the modified 3D file.

The implementation of the above steps is demonstrated in the examples below.

### **How to Create a New Scene Document**
