## **Add an Asset Information to 3D Scene**
Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates or makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage an information resource. Aspose.3D for .NET API allows developers to define a Metadata for the scene.
### **Define a Metadata for the scene**
3D shows produce massive quantities of metadata and picture information. Metadata is an asset and part of the show.

1. Initialize a 3D Scene using [`Scene`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene) class.
1. Set application/tool name.
1. Set application/tool vendor name.
1. Set measurement unit.
