description: Generally, some 3D file formats can store shadow related settings in geometry like FBX. Using Aspose.3D for .NET, developers can render an image by mapping shadows from the viewpoint of a light source. The image quality depends on the light source, elevation angle and distance between the camera and geometric objects.

Generally, some 3D file formats can store shadow related settings in geometry like FBX. Using [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net/), developers can render an image by mapping shadows from the viewpoint of a light source. The image quality depends on the light source, elevation angle and distance between the camera and geometric objects.

## **Cast and Receive Shadow**
By default, all objects in the scene cast shadows from a light source. Developers may also receive shadows on a per object basis in the object surface. This code example reveals how to set the position of light and camera objects. It also creates a plane and places three objects with different colors and shadow settings.

All geometries has `CastShadows = true` and `ReceiveShadows=true`, the shadows of red box and torus casted to the plane, the red box won't receive shadows and blue box won't cast shadows.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example casts and Receives shadows on 3D geometries.
