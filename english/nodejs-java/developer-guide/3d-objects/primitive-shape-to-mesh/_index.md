## **Convert Primitive Shape to Mesh**
Aspose.3D for Node.js via Java API has support of converting any primitive shape to mesh. Primitive shapes include most basic and used objects like box, sphere, plane, cylinder, and torus.

Any class that implements an interface IMeshConvertible can be converted to mesh while exporting to any 3D file format.

### **Convert Sphere Primitive to Mesh**
A sphere is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that appear everywhere from sports balls to planets in space. Let’s use the Sphere primitive to create a mesh.
The code example below converts a Sphere to mesh.

{{< highlight java >}}

var aspose = aspose || {};

aspose.threed = require("aspose.threed");

// Initialize object by Sphere class
var convertible = new aspose.threed.Sphere();

// Convert a Sphere to Mesh
var mesh = convertible.toMesh();

### **Convert Box to Mesh**
A Box describes a variety of containers and receptacles for permanent use as storage, or for temporary use, often for transporting contents. Let’s use the Box primitive to create a mesh. The code example below converts a Box to mesh.

{{< highlight java >}}

var aspose = aspose || {};

aspose.threed = require("aspose.threed");

// Initialize object by Box class
var convertible = new aspose.threed.Box();

// Convert a Box to Mesh
var mesh = convertible.toMesh();

### **Convert a Plane to Mesh**
A plane extends infinitely without thickness. An example of a plane is a coordinate plane. Lets use the Plane primitive to create a mesh. The code example below converts a Plane to mesh.

{{< highlight java >}}

var aspose = aspose || {};

aspose.threed = require("aspose.threed");

// Initialize object by Plane class
var convertible = new aspose.threed.Plane();

// Convert a Plane to Mesh
var mesh = convertible.toMesh();

### **Convert a Cylinder to Mesh**
A cylinder is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes, the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder. It can be used in many places, for example as a pillar in front of a home or as a car driveshaft. Lets use the Cylinder primitive to create a mesh. The code example below converts a Cylinder to mesh.

{{< highlight java >}}

var aspose = aspose || {};

aspose.threed = require("aspose.threed");

// Initialize object by Cylinder class
var convertible = new aspose.threed.Cylinder();

// Convert a Cylinder to Mesh
var mesh = convertible.toMesh();

### **Convert a Torus to Mesh**
A torus is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis coplanar with the circle. If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape and is called a torus of revolution. Let’s use the Torus primitive to create a mesh. The code example below converts a Torus to mesh.

{{< highlight java >}}

var aspose = aspose || {};

aspose.threed = require("aspose.threed");

// Initialize object by Torus class
var convertible = new aspose.threed.Torus();

// Convert a Torus to Mesh
var mesh = convertible.toMesh();
