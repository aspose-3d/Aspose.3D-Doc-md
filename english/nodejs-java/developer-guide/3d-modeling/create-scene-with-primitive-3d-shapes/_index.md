## **Build Scene from Primitive 3D Shapes**
Modeling is the process of pure creation and Aspose.3D API supports creating a scene with primitive 3D shapes.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example creates a scene with primitive 3D shapes and save in the OBJ file.

{{< highlight java >}}

var aspose = aspose || {};

aspose.threed = require("aspose.threed");

// Initialize a 3D scene
var scene = new aspose.threed.Scene();

// Create a Box model
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode("box", new aspose.threed.Box());

// Create a Cylinder model
scene.getRootNode().createChildNode("cylinder", new aspose.threed.Cylinder());

// Save drawing in the OBJ format
scene.save("test.obj");
