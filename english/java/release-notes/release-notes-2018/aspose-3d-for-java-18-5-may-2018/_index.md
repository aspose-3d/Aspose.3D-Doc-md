## **Aspose.3D for Java 18.5 Release Notes**
We are pleased to announce that the first version 18.5 of Aspose.3D for Java API has been released. After the release of Aspose.3D for .NET API, we have received requests from clients to build the same API for their Java applications. It is an auto-ported version from its equivalent .NET version 18.5. Aspose.3D for Java API is built to create, edit, manipulate and save 3D formats. It empowers Java applications to connect with 3D documents without installing any software package on the computer. Aspose.3D for Java API assist developers to model and create massive worlds in games, superb scenes for design visualization, and engage virtual reality experiences.
