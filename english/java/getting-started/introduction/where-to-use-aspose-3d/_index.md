Aspose.3D is designed to help developers create and manage 3D files programmatically. Aspose.3D can handle not only OBJ, STL, FBX, but also many other file formats like USDZ, GLTF, VRML, etc.

Aspose.3D provides most of the features to handle 3D files, but the exciting part is that Aspose.3D can repair, measure, convert, edit 3D files, which enables developers to process 3D files very quickly.

This article discusses the common scenarios for using Aspose.3D.
