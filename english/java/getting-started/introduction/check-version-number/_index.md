In some cases, you might wonder what version of the product you have. Often we build new fixes (bug fixes for the user scenarios which they point out) and post them in the forums against their need urgently. The version number consists of major version number, minor version number, and hotfix version number. All defined components must be integers greater than or equal to 0. The format of the version number is as follows:

major.minor.hotfix , we may increase a part by 1 and make a new version. Normally, we increase the last part by 1 and build a new fix to post it into the forums for the users.

This document describes some ways to check which version of the component is installed on your system.

## **Check Version Number Manually**

To find out which version of Aspose.3D you are using manually:

1. If you have Java version/fix (Aspose.3D for Java), you can unzip the Aspose.3D library jar file, open the MANIFEST file with notepad and search the string i.e.., â€œSpecification-Version: " to check its value.
1. Click the Version (or Details) tab to check the version number.
