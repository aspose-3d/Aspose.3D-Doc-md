## **Add Asset Information to 3D document**
Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates or makes it easier to retrieve, use or manage an information resource. Aspose.3D for Java API has support to define Metadata for the scene.

3D shows produce massive quantities of metadata and picture information. Metadata is an asset and part of the show.

1. Initialize a 3D Scene using **Scene** class.
1. Set application/tool name.
1. Set application/tool vendor name.
