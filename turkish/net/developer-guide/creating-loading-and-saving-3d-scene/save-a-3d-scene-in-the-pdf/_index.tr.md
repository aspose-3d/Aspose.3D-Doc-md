##  **Overview**

This article explains how you can convert 3D file to PDF format using C# .NET 3D file manipulation and conversion API, first you need to [load 3D file into Scene object](https://docs.aspose.com/3d/net/create-and-read-an-existing-3d-scene/) and then save it into PDF format. It covers wide range of topics e.g.

- Convert 3D to PDF in C#
- Convert FBX to PDF in C#
- Convert STL to PDF in C#
- Convert U3D to PDF in C#
- Convert OBJ to PDF in C#

The [`Scene`](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene) class of the Aspose.3D API represents a 3D scene. Developers can build a 3D scene by adding Camera, Light, polygons and various other entities. They can also now save a 3D scene in the PDF file format.

Aspose.3D for .NET directly writes the information about the API and Version Number in output documents. For example, upon rendering a Drawing to PDF, Aspose.3D for .NET populates `Application` field with value 'Aspose.3D' and `PDF Producer` field with value, e.g 'Aspose.3D 17.9'.

Please note that you cannot instruct Aspose.3D for .NET API to change or remove this information from output Documents.
