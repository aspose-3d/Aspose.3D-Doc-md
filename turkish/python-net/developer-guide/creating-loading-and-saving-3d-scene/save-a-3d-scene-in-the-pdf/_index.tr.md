Aspose.3D for Python via .NET directly writes the information about the API and Version Number in output documents. For example, upon rendering a Drawing to PDF, Aspose.3D for Python via .NET populates `Application` field with value 'Aspose.3D' and `PDF Producer` field with value, e.g 'Aspose.3D 17.9'.

Please note that you cannot instruct Aspose.Diagram for Python via .NET API to change or remove this information from output Documents.
