## **Generate Normal Data for All Meshes in a 3DS File**
The GenerateNormal method exposed by the [PolygonModifier](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/polygonmodifier) class can be used to generate normal data for all meshes in a 3DS file. If VertexElementSmoothingGroup element was defined in the mesh, the generated normal data will get smoothed by the VertexElementSmoothingGroup.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example loads a 3DS file, visit all nodes and create normal data for all meshes.
