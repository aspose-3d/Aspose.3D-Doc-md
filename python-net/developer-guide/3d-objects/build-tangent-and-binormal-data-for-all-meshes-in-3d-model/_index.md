Using [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](http://products.aspose.com/3d/net) API, developers can build tangent and binormal data for all meshes in any supported 3D file.

## **Build Tangent and Binormal data for Mesh**
We have added two BuildTangentBinormal methods in the [PolygonModifier](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/python-net/aspose.threed.entities/polygonmodifier) class. One method takes the [Scene](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene) class object as a parameter and another one takes the [Mesh](https://reference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.entities/mesh) class object as a parameter as shown in this code example:
