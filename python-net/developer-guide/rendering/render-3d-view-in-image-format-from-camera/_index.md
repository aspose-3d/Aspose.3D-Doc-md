## **Take a Picture of 3D Model from the Camera**
The Render method exposed by the [Scene](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/python-net/aspose.threed/scene) class can be used to take a picture from the active camera. Developers may also use the several different ways to navigate and position the camera in the scene. In this code example, we create a camera at position (10,10,10) in an existing 3D scene and look at the origin point for rendering.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example creates a camera in a 3D scene, sets its target and render an image.
