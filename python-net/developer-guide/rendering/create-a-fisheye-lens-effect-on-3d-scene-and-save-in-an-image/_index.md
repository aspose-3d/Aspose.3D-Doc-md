Using [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET API](https:#products.aspose.com/3d/python-net/), developers can create a Fisheye lens effect on 3D scene and save that view into the supported image formats.

## **Create a Fisheye lens effect**
In this article, we create a Camera and two Light objects to capture the scene, also create a render target, create a viewport and execute the Fisheye projection post-processing with the cube map as input and finally save the Fisheye texture. TheÂ Execute method of Renderer class allows to execute the post processing effect and save the result to render target.
### **Programming Sample**
This code example creates a Fisheye lens effect on 3D scene and save into the image format.

**Python**


```py

import aspose.threed as a3d
from aspose.pydrawing import Color
from aspose.pydrawing.imaging import ImageFormat

#load the scene

scene = a3d.Scene.from_file("test.glb");

#create a camera for capturing the cube map

cam = a3d.entities.Camera(a3d.entities.ProjectionType.PERSPECTIVE)

cam.near_plane = 0.1
cam.far_plane = 200
cam.rotation_mode = a3d.entities.RotationMode.FIXED_DIRECTION

scene.root_node.create_child_node(cam).transform.set_translation(5, 6, 0)



#create two lights to illuminate the scene

light = a3d.entities.Light()
light.light_type = a3d.entities.LightType.POINT

scene.root_node.create_child_node(light).transform.set_translation(-10, 7, -10)


light = a3d.entities.Light()
light.color = a3d.utilities.Vector3(Color.cadet_blue)


scene.root_node.create_child_node(light).transform.set_translation(49, 0, 49)


#create a renderer

with a3d.render.Renderer.create_renderer() as renderer:

    #Create a cube map render target with depth texture, depth is required when rendering a scene.
    rt = renderer.render_factory.create_cube_render_texture(a3d.render.RenderParameters(False), 512, 512)

    #create a 2D texture render target with no depth texture used for image processing
    final = renderer.rendere_factory.create_render_texture(a3d.render.RenderParameters(False, 32, 0, 0), 1024, 1024)



    #a viewport is required on the render target
    rt.create_viewport(cam, RelativeRectangle.from_scale(0, 0, 1, 1))

    renderer.render(rt)


    #execute the fisheye projection post-processing with the previous rendered cube map as input
    #the fisheye can have field of view more than 180 degree, so a cube map with all direction is required.

    fisheye = renderer.get_post_processing("fisheye")

    # we can change the fov to 360 instead of the default value 180.

    fisheye.find_property("fov").Value = 360.0

    #Specify the cube map rendered from the scene as this post processing's input

    fisheye.input = rt.targets[0]

    #Execute the post processing effect and save the result to render target final

    renderer.execute(fisheye, final)

    #save the texture into disk

    final.targets[0].save("fisheye.png", ImageFormat.PNG)


```
